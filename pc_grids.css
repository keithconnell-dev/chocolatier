/* Grid Rows Styles */
/*a simple selector*/div.row {
/*clear away prev floats that may be consistently happening within the document. this clear property will get away of  any previous floats in grid*/clear: both; }
/*parent element(div) with a class of row, use peudo element style for operatng the rest of the selector, : double colon is used to create the psuedo element. p-e is established in the style sheet, doesnt exist in  the html. this is known as the "clear-fix", meant to avoid container collapse, like when the footer collapses */ 
div.row::after {
   /*this is for columns?*/clear: both;
   /*this is enough to justify the use of text, but wont create a visible character*/content: "";
   /*tables cant be ignored, unlike blocks which are very stubborn. tables establish internally a hard to move structure, but if its a table of empty string it becomes a "fake table", noticile in browser memory, but not displayed and prevents table collapse*/
   display: table;   }
/**/


/* Grid Columns Styles */
/*problem is that the colums are not just one name, unlike the rows. columns are varied. colums are all divs, this property they share*/
div[class^="col-"] {
/**/float: left;  }

/*page 210 book.*/
div.com-1-1 {width:100%; }
div.col-1-2 {width: 50%; }
div.col-1-3 {width: 33.33%; }
div.col-2-3 {width: 66.67%; }
div.col-1-4 {width: 25%; }
div.col-3-4 {width:75%; }

/* Grid Outline Styles */

/*div {                     /*border: 2px solid blue;*/
/*width, style, color*/    /*outline: 1px solid red; }*/
